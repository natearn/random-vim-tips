The objective is to create a React component which provides randomized vim tips.

Constraints:

	- the component should be self-contained, requiring no specific configuration from the user
	- the component should be configurable to do either a single fetch or interval fetch for data
	- the component should expose a pure render function
	- the component should have a configurable api source

I will create a simple REST API server which will provide randomized tips.

Constraints:

	- responds with JSON
	- provides titles and links to full articles
	- can optionally produce tips in batches

While unnecessary, I would like to maintain a database of tips by sourcing vim.wikia.com.
I find this preferable to fetching the complete list of tips on every request.
The database will not need to be updated frequently, but should be updated automatically for completeness.

Challenges:

	- find free hosting for the API
	- automate db updates without using my own machine

The result should be a robust solution that could remain functional without any maintenance possibly indefinitely.
